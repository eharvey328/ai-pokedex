# AI Pokedex

This is a test between two AI agents using the [IBM Quantum Frontend Challenge](https://github.com/IBM/quantum-careers/tree/master/challenges/frontend)

1. IBM Bob
2. Claude Sonnet (4.6) with Vercel's [react-best-practices](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/react-best-practices) skill.

They were both given this prompt:

```
You are tasked with building a frontend application. Imagine this application serves as your interview for a software developer job. This means you should use this opportunity to showcase your skills as best as you can to try and stand out as an applicant. You should show your knowledge of modern frontend architecture, knowledge of frontend libraries and their features, creativity, and solid software patterns. In this folder are instructions at README.md and example images in example folder. Again I cannot stress this enough, it does not need to MATCH the example, it is only provided for context. You should build the very best version of the application you can to showcase your skills. You can add features that you think would be cool, you can use new software patterns that make the application more efficient, attempt to make the application as performant as you can, and design the application style to your heart’s desire.
```
